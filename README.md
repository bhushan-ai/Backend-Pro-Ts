# Backend-Pro-Ts

Welcome to **Backend-Pro-Ts** ‚Äî a curated collection of backend projects built with **TypeScript**, **Node.js**, and **Express.js**. This repository serves as a showcase of my journey in mastering backend development, focusing on best practices, scalability, and maintainability.

## üöÄ Projects Overview

Each folder in this repository represents a distinct backend project, demonstrating various concepts and technologies:

- **auth-backend-ts**: A user authentication system featuring:
  - JWT-based authentication
  - Role-based access control
  - Secure password hashing with bcrypt
  - MongoDB integration using Mongoose

Feel free to explore each project for detailed insights and implementations.
